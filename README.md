üí´ About Me:

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm an AI engineer with a strong background in Machine learning and Deep learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processes. I have a passion for discovering the Foundation behind any concept in the field and i'm actively seeking opportunities to work on real-world Projects.

üíº  I've spent nearly 1 years working on real-world projects in computer vision and Natural Language Processes. using Frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch, creating and using machine learning models for tasks.

üî¨ I possess a deep understanding of both classical computer vision methods and contemporary deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

üåü  I work well in teams and I have worked In collaborative environments to eliver end-to-end AI solutions.I'm also experienced in preprocessing and augmenting large-scale image datasets, training deep learning models, and optimizing their performance for production deployment.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of my work and projects.

üì´ You can reach me at redakariim3@gmail.com or connect with me on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)]('https://www.linkedin.com/in/kariim-reda-9a942b229')  to discuss collaborations, opportunities, or simply to chat about AI.
